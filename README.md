# Bit_Vector
A bit array (also known as bitmask, bit map, bit set, bit string, or bit vector) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits. 
It can be used to implement a simple set data structure. 
A bit array is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly.
