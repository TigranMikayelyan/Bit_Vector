<h1>Bit_Vector</h1>
<hr>       
<i> <br> A bit vector is a container that stores a sequence of bits (0s and 1s) in a compact and efficient way. It is implemented using a dynamically allocated array of integers, where each integer stores a fixed number of bits (typically 32 or 64). </i>

<b>

A bit array (also known as bitmask, bit map, bit set, bit string, or bit vector) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits. 
It can be used to implement a simple set data structure. 
A bit array is effective at exploiting bit-level parallelism in hardware to perform operations quickly. </b>

If you want to compile this code.
You must write

```
g++ -std=c++2a main.cpp implementation.cpp

```

and then if you want to run this code you must write

```
./a.out 

```
